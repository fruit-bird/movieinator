# Movienator

A CLI to store information about movies

Uses sqlite as means of storage

## Usage
```
Usage: movienator <COMMAND>

Commands:
  add     Add a movie entry
  list    Print movie info
  remove  Remove a movie
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

## Setup
Setup may be needed to specify a custom path where the database will be stored. To define that path, modify the [`PATH_TO_DATABASE`](https://github.com/fruit-bird/movienator/blob/8fce6cfa93b5681eb5a26392eb4ff608d4effa29/setup.sh#L7) variable in [`setup.sh`](setup.sh). Otherwise, it defaults to storing it in `~/Documents`

This script is written for a `zsh` terminal

The script does not need to be exectued manually. It gets automatically ran when building the project with the help of [`build.rs`](build.rs)

## Example
```bash
$ movienator add "Cloud Atlas" -d 1970-01-01 -r 5
  "Cloud Atlas" has been added!

$ movienator add "Interstellar" -r 5 -t "Realistic black hole"
  "Interstellar" has been added!
  
$ movienator list
  You have 2 movies stored
  * | Cloud Atlas                             |  1970-01-01  |   5/5   | (no thoughts)
  * | Interstellar                            |   ________   |   5/5   | Realistic black hole
```

## Cool Things
### Terminal Tab Completion
You can find in `/completions` an autogenerated `.sh` file made by [`clap_complete`](https://crates.io/crates/clap_complete) in a few lines

```rust
// code to generate the autocomplete
let mut cmd = MovieCLI::command();

clap_complete::generate_to(
    clap_complete::Shell::Zsh,
    &mut cmd,
    "movienator",
    "completions",
)?;
```

### Customized Display
I'm especially proud of the `movienator list` command; its display formatting, paging, sorting and broad search capabilities

## What is This?
Just trying to pick up [`sqlx`](https://crates.io/crates/sqlx), ended up picking up some shell scripting, environment stuff, and build files. Awesome

And for how simple this is, it could be generalized to store more than movies
